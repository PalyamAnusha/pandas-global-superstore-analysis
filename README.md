# Sales Data Analysis with Pandas

This project demonstrates how to load, clean, analyze, and visualize a sales dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It explores the Global Superstore dataset to extract key insights such as sales trends, top products by revenue, and profit distribution by region.

## Project Overview

- Load and preprocess sales data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with summary statistics
- Calculate important KPIs like total sales, total profit, and profit margin
- Visualize monthly sales trends
- Identify top 10 products by revenue
- Analyze profit by region
- Export analysis results to an Excel workbook

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Global Superstore Dataset** downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irfanasrullah/global-superstore-dataset). The dataset contains sales transaction details, customer information, product data, and geographic details.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended) along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- openpyxl

## You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
```

## How to Run
Download the dataset (Global_Superstore2.csv) and place it in your working directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Sales_Data_Analysis.ipynb) included in this repository.
Run the notebook cells step-by-step to load data, clean it, perform analysis, and generate visualizations.
The analysis results will also be saved in an Excel file (Sales_Analysis.xlsx).
